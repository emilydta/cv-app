# cv-app

A basic CV maker app. Built with CRA.

This project was completed as part of The Odin Project curriculum: https://www.theodinproject.com/

<h2>Reflection</h2>

  - I think the code can be further condensed into components (e.g. moving some of the state into respective components). I may go back at some point and try to do this. However, the way the app relies on information from state currently makes this a bit difficult to do. And right now I'd rather invest time moving through the rest of the Odin curriculum.
